🍎 **App Store rejected your streaming app? Probably HLS compliance.**

Your iOS video streaming app just got rejected from the App Store. Reason: "HLS streams do not comply with Apple specifications." Three months of development down the drain.

📱 **The iOS Developer Reality:**
Apple requires strict HLS compliance for video streaming apps. One malformed playlist = instant App Store rejection.

❌ **The Traditional Problem:**
- Download Xcode command line tools (8GB+)
- Install MediaStreamValidator locally on macOS only
- Learn complex command syntax
- Manually validate every stream variant
- Cross fingers on submission day

✅ **The Modern Solution:**
Apple's official MediaStreamValidator, now as a simple API call. Validate any HLS stream in seconds and get an instant compliance report before App Store submission.

🎯 **What Gets Validated:**
- RFC 8216 HLS specification compliance
- Apple-specific requirements (critical for iOS)
- Playlist structure and segment timing
- Codec compatibility across Apple devices
- Variant stream consistency

📊 **Real Impact:**
✅ iOS Developers: Zero App Store rejections due to HLS issues
✅ QA Teams: Automated compliance testing in CI/CD
✅ Engineering Teams: Cross-platform validation (any OS, any language)
✅ Content Teams: Catch encoding issues early

💡 **Customer Success:** "We went from 2-week App Store review cycles with rejections to first-time approvals every time."
