# The FFmpeg Team Called Us Out (And They're Right)

The FFmpeg team just posted about Probe.dev, and honestly? They nailed it.

**"There is literally a startup providing an API call around ffprobe, FFmpeg's probing tool."**

**(for once a startup is honest that they are providing a simple wrapper around FFmpeg)**

Yes, we absolutely are. And we're proud of it.

## Here's why that matters

After spending years at Encoding.com watching engineering teams struggle with media analysis at scale, one thing became crystal clear: **FFprobe and MediaInfo are foundational tools that everyone uses, but nobody wants to manage.**

Every major media platform relies on these tools:
- Netflix uses FFmpeg for their entire encoding pipeline
- YouTube's infrastructure is built on FFmpeg
- Bitmovin, Mux, Cloudflare Stream - all FFmpeg under the hood

But here's what the FFmpeg team gets right in their observation: **most companies in our space don't admit this.**

## The real problem we're solving

It's not that FFprobe doesn't work. It's that managing FFprobe (and MediaInfo, and MediaStreamValidator) at scale is a nightmare:

- **Version consistency** across environments
- **Scale bottlenecks** when processing thousands of files
- **Infrastructure overhead** for what should be a simple API call
- **Tool reconciliation** when FFprobe and MediaInfo disagree
- **Streaming protocol support** for HLS, DASH, RTMP, RTSP

We spent a decade watching engineering teams rebuild the same media analysis infrastructure over and over. The tools work perfectly - the operational layer around them doesn't scale.

## Why transparency matters

The FFmpeg team applauds us for being honest about our foundation, and they should. Too many companies in our space treat FFmpeg like a dirty secret instead of acknowledging the incredible work that powers their entire business.

FFmpeg is **the** foundational library of modern media processing. Period.

We're not trying to replace it. We're trying to make it easier to use at scale, with better consistency, and without the operational headaches.

## The service layer the industry needs

Every engineering team shouldn't have to solve:
- FFmpeg version management
- Queue handling for concurrent analysis
- Error handling across different tool versions
- Output reconciliation between tools
- Infrastructure scaling for analysis workloads

That's not innovation. That's reinventing the wheel.

**We built the service layer so engineering teams can focus on building great products instead of babysitting FFprobe deployments.**

The FFmpeg team built the engine. We built the gas station.

Both are necessary. Both have value.

**Thank you to the FFmpeg team for building the tools that power the entire media industry. And thank you for calling out companies that should give credit where it's due.**

*P.S. - If you're at a media company still managing FFprobe infrastructure internally, you know exactly what pain we're solving. If you're not, trust me - you don't want to find out.*
