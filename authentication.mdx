## API Token

After [signing up](https://www.probe.dev/dashboard), you'll receive your `PROBE_API_TOKEN`. This token identifies your account and provides access to the API.

<Warning>
Keep your API token secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Authentication Methods

Choose the method that works best for your use case:

### Header Authentication (Recommended)

Include your token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROBE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/file?url=https://example.com/video.mp4&only=ffprobe"
```

**Benefits:**
- Keeps secrets out of URLs and server logs
- More secure than query parameters
- Standard HTTP authentication method

### Query Parameter Authentication

Include your token as a query parameter:

```bash
curl "https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/file?token=$PROBE_API_TOKEN&url=https://example.com/video.mp4&only=ffprobe"
```

**Use cases:**
- Quick testing with cURL
- Simple integrations
- When headers are difficult to set

## Getting Your API Token

1. **Sign up** at [probe.dev/dashboard](https://www.probe.dev/dashboard)
2. **Verify your email** address
3. **Access your dashboard** to view your API token
4. **Copy your API token** for use in requests

## Rate Limits & Usage

Your API usage is tracked per token. Monitor your usage in the [dashboard](https://www.probe.dev/dashboard) to see:

- **Request count** - Total API calls made
- **Processing time** - Cumulative analysis time  
- **Data processed** - Total media data analyzed
- **Queue metrics** - Current processing status

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Environment Variables">
    Store your API token in environment variables rather than hardcoding it:
    
    ```bash
    export PROBE_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="Token Rotation">
    Regularly rotate your API tokens, especially if:
    - They may have been compromised
    - Team members with access have left
    - You're migrating to a new system
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="eye-slash" title="Access Control">
    - Never commit tokens to version control
    - Use secure secret management in production
    - Limit token access to necessary team members
    - Monitor usage for unexpected patterns
