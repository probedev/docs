## Week 1: Launch - The Video Analysis Infrastructure Problem

**Hook:** "Just spent 3 hours debugging why FFprobe 6.0 and 7.0 return different duration values for the same DASH manifest. Again."

**Content:**
Video engineering teams waste countless hours managing media analysis infrastructure:

üîß **Tool Version Hell**: FFprobe 6.0 vs 7.0 inconsistencies, MediaInfo version mismatches across environments
‚ö° **Scale Bottlenecks**: Local analysis chokes on high-volume pipelines  
üêõ **Silent Failures**: Inconsistent error handling across different tool versions
üì¶ **Dependency Management**: Keeping FFmpeg builds updated, managing MediaInfo libraries

We built Probe.dev to solve this. One API, multiple analysis engines, guaranteed consistency.

**Technical Deep Dive:**
```bash
# Your current pain point
ffprobe -version  # 6.0 on staging, 7.0 on prod ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Our solution - specify exact versions
curl -G https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/file \
  --data-urlencode "ffprobe[version]=6.0" \
  --data-urlencode "url=your-manifest.mpd"
```

**The Result**: Same analysis, every time, any scale.

**CTA**: See our version compatibility matrix and migration examples: [API Documentation](https://docs.probe.dev/guides/migration-guide#tool-version-compatibility)

## Week 2: HLS Compliance - App Store Rejections Are Expensive

**Hook:** "App Store rejection: 'HLS stream does not meet technical requirements.' No other details. Sound familiar?"

**Content:**
Apple's HLS compliance requirements are notoriously strict, and manual validation is painful:

‚ùå **Common Rejection Reasons:**
- Missing 64kbps audio-only variant
- BANDWIDTH attribute mismatch  
- Segment duration exceeds EXT-X-TARGETDURATION
- Incomplete bitrate ladder (< 3 levels)

‚úÖ **MediaStreamValidator as a Service:**
```bash
# Validate before submission
curl -G https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/mediastreamvalidator \
  --data-urlencode "url=https://your-cdn.com/master.m3u8" \
  --data-urlencode "parse_playlist_only=false"
```

**Real Technical Benefits:**
- Apple's actual MediaStreamValidator tool (v1.24.5)
- Segment-level analysis, not just playlist validation
- Detailed compliance reports for App Store documentation
- CI/CD integration for automated validation

**Production Integration:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: HLS Compliance Check
  run: |
    curl -s -G https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/mediastreamvalidator \
      --data-urlencode "token=$PROBE_TOKEN" \
      --data-urlencode "url=$HLS_URL" | \
    jq -r '.success' | grep -q true || exit 1
```

## Week 3: Streaming Protocol Analysis - Beyond Static Files

**Hook:** "Need to analyze a live RTMP stream? FFprobe locally times out. MediaInfo doesn't handle DASH manifests properly. What's your solution?"

**Content:**
Modern video workflows aren't just about static files. You need analysis for:

üì° **Live Streaming Protocols:**
- RTMP ingest analysis for encoding validation
- RTSP camera feeds for surveillance pipelines  
- SRT streams for low-latency delivery

üìä **Adaptive Streaming Formats:**
- DASH manifest parsing with representation analysis
- HLS playlist validation across bitrate variants
- Multi-track analysis (video, audio, captions)

**Technical Example - DASH Analysis:**
```bash
# Each DASH representation shows as separate track
curl -G https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/file \
  --data-urlencode "url=https://cdn.bitmovin.com/.../manifest.mpd" \
  --data-urlencode "inject_json=true"

# Response includes individual tracks for each quality level:
# - 320x180 @ 250kbps
# - 480x270 @ 400kbps  
# - 640x360 @ 800kbps
# - etc.
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Streaming QA validation in CI/CD
- Live stream health monitoring  
- ABR ladder optimization analysis
- Cross-protocol content delivery validation

**Performance Note**: RTMP/RTSP analysis ~500ms average, same as static files.

**CTA**: See all supported streaming formats and protocols: [Streaming Analysis Guide](https://docs.probe.dev/guides/streaming-analysis)

## Week 4: Analysis Tool Reconciliation - The Metadata Consistency Problem

**Hook:** "FFprobe says duration is 634.567s. MediaInfo says 634.566s. Which one is correct for your billing system?"

**Content:**
Every video engineer has faced this: different tools, different results.

üîç **The Problem:**
```json
// FFprobe output
{"duration": "634.567000"}

// MediaInfo output  
{"duration": "634.566"}

// Your billing system breaks üí•
```

üß† **Probe Report Solution:**
Machine learning trained on >1 billion assets to reconcile tool inconsistencies:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/file \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4",
    "ffprobe": {"enabled": true},
    "mediainfo": {"enabled": true}, 
    "probe_report": {"enabled": true, "diff": true}
  }'
```

**Technical Deep Dive:**
- Structural diff between FFprobe/MediaInfo outputs
- ML heuristics correct known tool inconsistencies  
- Single authoritative metadata set
- ~0ms generation time (instant from existing data)

**Real-World Impact:**
- Consistent billing calculations
- Reliable content management metadata
- Eliminated tool version dependency issues
- Single source of truth for downstream systems

**Bonus**: The `diff` field shows exactly what was reconciled, perfect for debugging tool discrepancies.

## Week 5: Scale & Performance - When Local Analysis Breaks Down

**Hook:** "Processing 10,000 files/hour with local FFprobe? Your servers are crying. Your AWS bill isn't happy either."

**Content:**
Video analysis at scale exposes brutal infrastructure realities:

üìà **Scale Challenges:**
- CPU utilization spikes with concurrent analysis
- Memory leaks in long-running FFmpeg processes
- Inconsistent performance across instance types
- Queue management for high-volume processing

‚ö° **Probe.dev Performance Reality:**
```
Analysis Speed (average):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FFprobe: ~500ms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MediaInfo: ~500ms  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Probe Report: ~0ms (instant)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ All tools: ~500ms (not 8-15s!)
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Auto-scaling infrastructure handles traffic spikes
- Consistent performance regardless of file complexity
- No memory leaks or process management
- Built-in queue management with 60s max wait

**Technical Comparison:**
```bash
# Your current setup
for file in *.mp4; do
  ffprobe "$file" > "${file}.json" &
done
wait  # Pray your servers survive

# With Probe.dev
parallel -j 100 'curl -G https://api.probe.dev/v1/probe/file \
  --data-urlencode "url=https://cdn.example.com/{}" \
  > {}.json' ::: *.mp4
```

**Cost Reality Check:**
- No EC2 instances for analysis processing
- No FFmpeg license management
- No infrastructure scaling concerns  
- Pay per analysis, not per idle server

**Production Stats** (from real customers):
- 100 requests/minute rate limit per token
- 10 concurrent requests per token
- 99.9% uptime across multiple regions
- Sub-second response times

**CTA**: See migration examples and performance benchmarks: [Migration Guide](https://docs.probe.dev/guides/migration-guide)
