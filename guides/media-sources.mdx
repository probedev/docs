## Overview

Probe.dev can analyze media files from various sources. Simply provide a direct link to your media file, and our API will securely fetch and analyze it.

## Public URLs

The simplest approach is to provide a direct HTTP/HTTPS URL to your media file:

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com/videos/sample.mp4"
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be publicly accessible
- Must be a direct link to the media file (not a webpage)
- Supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols

## Amazon S3 Integration

### Public S3 Buckets

For publicly accessible S3 objects, use the standard S3 URL format:

```json
{
    "url": "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/video.mp4"
}
```

### Key-Based Authorization

For private S3 objects, include your AWS access credentials directly in the URL:

```http
https://KEY:SECRET@s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/PATH
s3://KEY:SECRET@BUCKET/PATH
```

**Example:**
```json
{
    "url": "https://AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY@s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/video.mp4"
}
```

<Warning>
Be careful when using access keys in URLs as they may appear in logs. Consider using presigned URLs for better security.
</Warning>

### Presigned URLs

For private S3 objects, create a presigned URL with temporary access:

```json
{
    "url": "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/sample-video.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE%2F20250506%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250506T121314Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Temporary access (configurable expiration)
- No credentials in the URL path
- More secure than embedded keys

### Creating Presigned URLs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="aws" title="AWS CLI">
    Generate a presigned URL using the AWS CLI:
    
    ```bash
    aws s3 presign s3://my-bucket/video.mp4 --expires-in 3600
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="AWS SDK (Node.js)">
    Use the AWS SDK to generate presigned URLs programmatically:
    
    ```javascript
    const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
    const s3 = new AWS.S3();
    
    const params = {
        Bucket: 'my-bucket',
        Key: 'video.mp4',
        Expires: 3600 // 1 hour
    };
    
    const url = s3.getSignedUrl('getObject', params);
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="python" title="AWS SDK (Python)">
    Generate presigned URLs with boto3:
    
    ```python
    import boto3
    from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
    
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    
    try:
        response = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
            'get_object',
            Params={'Bucket': 'my-bucket', 'Key': 'video.mp4'},
            ExpiresIn=3600
        )
    except ClientError as e:
        logging.error(e)
        return None
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Other Cloud Storage

### Google Cloud Storage

```json
{
    "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/video.mp4"
}
```

### Azure Blob Storage

```json
{
    "url": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/my-container/video.mp4"
}
```

### Cloudflare R2

```json
{
    "url": "https://my-bucket.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/video.mp4"
}
```

## CDN and Streaming Services

Probe.dev works with media served through CDNs and streaming platforms:

### Content Delivery Networks
- **CloudFront** - Amazon's CDN
- **CloudFlare** - Global CDN
- **Fastly** - Edge cloud platform
- **KeyCDN** - High performance CDN

### Streaming Platforms
- **Vimeo** - Direct links to video files
- **YouTube** - Public video URLs
- **Twitch** - VOD direct links

<Note>
Some platforms require specific URL formats or may have rate limiting. Ensure you're using direct media file URLs, not embed links.
</Note>

## URL Validation Tips

### Valid URL Examples ✅
```
https://example.com/video.mp4
https://cdn.example.com/media/stream.mkv
https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/folder/file.avi
ftp://server.com/media/video.mov
```

### Invalid URL Examples ❌
```
https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123        // Embed page, not direct file
https://example.com/player.html           // HTML player page
https://drive.google.com/file/d/abc       // Google Drive share link
file:///local/path/video.mp4              // Local file path
```

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access Control" icon="shield-check">
    - Use presigned URLs for private content
    - Set appropriate expiration times
    - Limit access to specific IP ranges when possible
    - Monitor access logs for unusual activity
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="URL Management" icon="link">
    - Don't embed credentials in URLs when possible
    - Use HTTPS for all media URLs
    - Validate URLs before sending to API
    - Consider URL shortening for very long presigned URLs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Error** | **Cause** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `403 Forbidden` | Private content, credentials missing | Use presigned URL or add credentials |
| `404 Not Found` | Incorrect URL or file doesn't exist | Verify URL and file existence |
| `Timeout` | Large file or slow connection | Check file size and network connectivity |
| `Invalid URL` | Malformed URL | Validate URL format |

### Testing Media Sources

Verify your media URL is accessible:

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -I "https://your-media-url.com/video.mp4"

# Should return HTTP 200 and Content-Type: video/*
```
