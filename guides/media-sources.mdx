## Overview

Probe.dev can analyze media files from various sources including traditional file formats, adaptive streaming formats (HLS, DASH), and live streaming protocols (RTMP, RTSP, SRT). Simply provide a direct link to your media asset, and our API will securely fetch and analyze it.

## Static Media Files

### Public URLs

The simplest approach is to provide a direct HTTP/HTTPS URL to your media file:

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com/videos/sample.mp4"
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be publicly accessible
- Must be a direct link to the media file (not a webpage)
- Supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols

## Streaming Formats

### HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

Analyze HLS playlists and their associated media segments:

```json
{
    "url": "https://probelibrary.s3.amazonaws.com/hls/sample/big_buck_bunny.m3u8"
}
```

**Supported HLS features:**
- Master playlists (multi-bitrate)
- Media playlists (single bitrate)
- Video, audio, and subtitle tracks
- Variant streams analysis
- Segment information

<Note>
HLS analysis provides detailed information about adaptive bitrate ladders, segment durations, and track configurations.
</Note>

### DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming)

Examine DASH manifests and media presentations:

```json
{
    "url": "https://cdn.bitmovin.com/content/assets/art-of-motion-dash-hls-progressive/mpds/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd"
}
```

**Supported DASH features:**
- Media Presentation Description (MPD) analysis
- Adaptation sets and representations
- Video, audio, and text tracks
- Segment templates and timelines
- Initialization segments

<Tip>
DASH analysis reveals codec profiles, bitrate ladders, and segment structure for adaptive streaming optimization.
</Tip>

## Streaming Protocols

### RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)

Analyze live RTMP streams and Video on Demand (VOD) content:

```json
{
    "url": "rtmp://matthewc.co.uk/vod/scooter"
}
```

**Common RTMP URL formats:**
```
rtmp://server.example.com/live/stream_key
rtmp://server.example.com/vod/video_name
rtmps://secure.example.com/live/stream_key
```

### RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol)

Probe RTSP streams for metadata and technical specifications:

```json
{
    "url": "rtsp://server.example.com:554/stream/video"
}
```

**Common RTSP URL formats:**
```
rtsp://server.example.com/stream_name
rtsp://server.example.com:554/live/stream
rtsps://secure.example.com/secure_stream
```

### SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)

Analyze SRT streams for low-latency video delivery:

```json
{
    "url": "srt://server.example.com:1234"
}
```

**SRT URL formats:**
```
srt://server.example.com:port
srt://server.example.com:port?streamid=stream_name
```

<Warning>
Streaming protocol analysis may have longer processing times compared to static files due to the need to establish connections and buffer content.
</Warning>

## Content Types Supported

## Example Analysis Results

### HLS Stream Analysis
When analyzing an HLS playlist, you'll receive information about:

```json
{
  "master_playlist": {
    "variant_streams": [
      {
        "bandwidth": 1200000,
        "resolution": "1280x720",
        "codecs": "avc1.4d401f,mp4a.40.2",
        "uri": "720p.m3u8"
      }
    ]
  },
  "media_segments": {
    "target_duration": 10,
    "sequence_number": 0,
    "segments_count": 180
  }
}
```

### RTMP Stream Analysis
RTMP stream analysis provides real-time stream characteristics:

```json
{
  "stream_info": {
    "video_codec": "H264",
    "audio_codec": "AAC",
    "resolution": "1920x1080",
    "frame_rate": 30,
    "bitrate": 2500000
  }
}
```

## Amazon S3 Integration

### Public S3 Buckets

For publicly accessible S3 objects, use the standard S3 URL format:

```json
{
    "url": "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/video.mp4"
}
```

### Key-Based Authorization

For private S3 objects, include your AWS access credentials directly in the URL:

```http
https://KEY:SECRET@s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/PATH
s3://KEY:SECRET@BUCKET/PATH
```

**Example:**
```json
{
    "url": "https://AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY@s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/video.mp4"
}
```

<Warning>
Be careful when using access keys in URLs as they may appear in logs. Consider using presigned URLs for better security.
</Warning>

### Presigned URLs

For private S3 objects, create a presigned URL with temporary access:

```json
{
    "url": "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/sample-video.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE%2F20250506%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250506T121314Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Temporary access (configurable expiration)
- No credentials in the URL path
- More secure than embedded keys

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Error** | **Cause** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `403 Forbidden` | Private content, credentials missing | Use presigned URL or add credentials |
| `404 Not Found` | Incorrect URL or file doesn't exist | Verify URL and file existence |
| `Timeout` | Large file, slow connection, or stream buffer time | Check file size, network connectivity, and stream availability |
| `Invalid URL` | Malformed URL | Validate URL format |
| `Stream Unavailable` | RTMP/RTSP stream offline | Verify stream is active and accessible |

### Testing Media Sources

Verify your media URL is accessible:

```bash
# Test static files with curl
curl -I "https://your-media-url.com/video.mp4"

# Test HLS playlist
curl -I "https://your-hls-url.com/playlist.m3u8"

# Should return HTTP 200 and appropriate Content-Type
```

### Testing Streaming Protocols

```bash
# Test RTMP stream with FFprobe
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format rtmp://server.com/live/stream

# Test RTSP stream
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format rtsp://camera.com:554/stream
```
